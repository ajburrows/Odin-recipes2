        Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish consisting of alternating layers of flat, wide pasta, rich ragù (a hearty meat-based sauce), and creamy béchamel sauce, 
        all topped with a generous sprinkle of grated cheese. This culinary delight is baked to perfection, allowing the flavors to meld together into a delicious, 
        gooey, and satisfying casserole. Often, variations include the addition of vegetables like spinach or mushrooms, and alternative sauces such as marinara or 
        alfredo, making lasagna a versatile dish that can be adapted to different tastes and dietary preferences.</p>

        flavor make it a favorite for breakfast or as a snack. The simplicity of its preparation—mashing bananas and mixing them with common pantry staples—adds 
        to its popularity, making it a go-to recipe for home bakers. Whether served plain, slathered with butter, or drizzled with honey, banana bread offers a 
        satisfying treat for any time of the day.</p>

        guacamole, or queso. Their sturdy texture makes them ideal for scooping and dipping, enhancing their appeal as a versatile and beloved snack. Whether enjoyed
